## Research Interests

- Optoelectronic devices
- Machine Learning

My current research focuses on practical problems that use an optical motion capture device to assist with cardiac ultrasound. My undergraduate studies focused on semiconductor physics and the theory of optoelectronic devices. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and **Optoelectronic devices** though they are quite different. I believe that whether it is the integration of medicine and engineering or the study of micro-nano devices, it will contribute to the development of society. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
